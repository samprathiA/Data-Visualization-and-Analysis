# Data-Visualization-and-Analysis
This repositary provides an insight into all the data analysis that I have done on comercial data, assuming certain business chellenges.
I chose to solve these assumed challeges depending on the type of data. 
My analysis for retail data involved visuals that reflected the sales and customer profiles to make certain inferences.
Where as analysis of 'REVIEWS' involved sentiment analysis because customer's sentiment(feelings) is in association with the unstructured 
data and setiment analysis would perfectly explain my chosen challenges.
